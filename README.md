# cashapp-payment-processor

## Update:
Please refer to the original branch to use the upgraded revision which utilizes the webapp to determine if the transaction was sent through account balance or a credit card. This implementation is not capable of determining that. This version is not recomended for production enviroments and is for research purposes only.

A simple python cashapp payment processor (the only one on GitHub that actualy works)

Modded by chillwave

Uses JSON for simple storage, uses re to find values for note and the amount sent!
