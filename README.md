# cashapp-payment-processor
A simple python cashapp payment processor (the only one on GitHub that actualy works)

Uses JSON for simple storage, uses re to find values for note and the amount sent!

There are not a lot of working free IMAP email providers what I use when I made this is [zoho](https://www.zoho.com/) for help with imap with zoho you can use this [guide](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/imap-access.html)

For any issues file a issue, for any new features you want to contribute you can make a pull request!!

**you have to loop the** `cashapp.fetchmail()` **function in order to use efficently**

**To use with gmail, read this** [guide](https://github.com/LiteEagle262/cashapp-payment-processor/blob/main/Gmail.md)
