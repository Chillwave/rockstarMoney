# Gmail implementation guide!

To use gmail with this, you will have to forward all incoming emails from cashapp to your zoho email, (dont worry you still see it in your main gmail as well)

to do this go to `gmail >> settings >> see all settings >> Filters and Blocked Addresses` once there click create a filter, once on that page settings are below

```
From: cash@square.com
```
Once done click add a forwarding address, once there type in your zoho email

Next repeat that process but when on the option that says `Forward it to:` choose your zoho email, click create filter, then your done!
